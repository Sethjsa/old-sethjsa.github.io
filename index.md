## About

I am an NLP Researcher, with a Master's degree in Speech & Language Processing from Edinburgh University. My research interests include:

- Sample efficiency via inductive linguistic biases
- Machine Translation for low-resource languages
- Theoretical syntax (incl. Minimalist Grammar and CCG)

For my Master's dissertation (available [here](https://sethjsa.github.io/SJSA_MSc_Dissertation.pdf){:target="_blank"}), I was supervised by [Dr. Miloš Stanojević](https://stanojevic.github.io){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Mark Steedman](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/steedman/){:target="_blank"}. For my [Undergraduate dissertation](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/files/copil_12_1_aycock.pdf){:target="_blank"}, I was supervised by [Prof. Ian Roberts](https://www.dow.cam.ac.uk/people/professor-ian-roberts){:target="_blank"}.
