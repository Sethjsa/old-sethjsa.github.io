## About

I am an NLP and Computational Linguistics Researcher, with a Master's degree from Edinburgh University in Speech & Language Processing. My research interests, among others, include:

- Incorporating linguistic knowledge into NLP models
- Machine Translation (especially low-resource MT)
- Theoretical syntax (Minimalist Grammar and CCG)

For my Master's dissertation (available upon request), I was supervised by [Dr. Miloš Stanojević](https://stanojevic.github.io){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Mark Steedman](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/steedman/){:target="_blank"}. For my [Undergraduate dissertation](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/files/copil_12_1_aycock.pdf){:target="_blank"}, I was supervised by [Prof. Ian Roberts](https://www.dow.cam.ac.uk/people/professor-ian-roberts){:target="_blank"}.
