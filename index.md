## About

I am an NLP and Computational Linguistics Researcher, with a Master's degree from Edinburgh University in Speech & Language Processing. My academic interests, among others, include:

- Incorporating linguistic knowledge into NLP models
- Machine Translation (especially low-resource MT)
- Theoretical syntax (Minimalist Grammar and CCG)

For my [Master's dissertation](https://github.com/Sethjsa/Sethjsa.github.io/files/7449565/MSc.SLP.Dissertation.-.B178385_7979.1.pdf), I was supervised by [Dr. Miloš Stanojević](https://stanojevic.github.io) and [Prof. Mark Steedman](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/steedman/). For my [Undergraduate dissertation](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/files/copil_12_1_aycock.pdf), I was supervised by [Prof. Ian Roberts](https://www.dow.cam.ac.uk/people/professor-ian-roberts).
